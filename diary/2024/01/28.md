# Philosophy (in no particular order, except the first one)

* Hofstadter’s Law says it is always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.
* Have a bias for action. If I can do something in a few minutes, do it now. If I hesitate on things that take little time, I won’t be decisive on things that take a lot of deliberation. Act fast is not as risky as it seems, because I can stop quickly.
* Optimism and courage are difficult to maintain, so protect them at all cost. It is easy to doubt. Self-doubt is especially harmful because it provides a circular logic to how everything seems to work.
* Serve others. We are capable of giving way more than what we receive. There is nothing to lose by giving more, as the well will overflow with fresh spring.
* My happiness comes from peace. Peace with others. Peace with myself.
* You don’t need a big audience when you have the right audience.
